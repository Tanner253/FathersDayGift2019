This application was made for my father on fathers day, where the main goal is to allow customers to contact my father by email.
upon landing on the site you will be greeted and can learn more about my dad and his services, and near the bottom you can fill out a form that i have hooked up with the SendGrid api to administer
email sending from the site/form/client to my father.
overall the project was and is a success.
